# Netflix-Data-Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal of this analysis is to explore and derive insights from the dataset through various data exploration and visualization techniques. Key tasks include identifying and removing duplicates, handling missing values, and analyzing trends and patterns in TV shows and movies available on Netflix.

**Key Tasks and Analysis:**
**Duplicate Record Removal:** Identified and removed any duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data quality.
**Missing Value Handling:** Used heatmaps to detect and visualize any null values present in the dataset, then handled missing data appropriately.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted in-depth analysis of key features such as Show Id, Director, Category, Country, Rating, Duration, and Year.
**Trend Analysis:** Analyzed the release trends of TV Shows and Movies across different years to identify peak release periods.
**Country-Specific Insights:** Explored TV shows and movies released in specific countries, such as India, and identified the country with the highest number of TV shows.
**Directorial Insights:** Identified top directors contributing to the largest number of Netflix shows and movies.
**Genre & Ratings Analysis:** Investigated movie ratings, genres, and the types of shows available on Netflix.
**Custom Queries:** Various custom queries were used to gain insights into specific aspects of the dataset (e.g., movies released in a certain year, rating distribution in specific countries, and actors featured in shows).

**Tools and Libraries Used:**

**Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis.

**Pandas:** For data manipulation and handling.

**NumPy:** For numerical operations.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and creating insightful charts.

**Jupyter Notebook:** For performing the analysis in an interactive environment.
